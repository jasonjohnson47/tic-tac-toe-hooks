# Tic Tac Toe Using Hooks

This project is based on the [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), but has been re-written to use [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). It is also written in TypeScript, and uses Jest and React Testing Library for tests. I'm sure there are more tests that should be written, but this has just been a learning experience.
